loadbars (0.6.0.99) precise; urgency=low

  * New dev branch

 -- Paul Buetow <pb@venus>  Thu, 26 Jul 2012 08:24:11 +0200

loadbars (0.6.0.5) stable; urgency=low

  * Introducing network stats. Network stats toggle button is 3
    The new --netint INTNAME startup param specifies the nic to observe.
    The new --hasnet 0|1 startup params specifies whether to display network 
    stats on startup. 
    The new --netlink SPEED startup params specifies the network interface 
    speed to assume on startup on the given nic. Possible values are mbit,
    10mbit, 100mbit, gbit, 10gbit or just a number which is interpreted as 
    mbytes/s. If no --netlink param is given the standard NIC speed is set to
    1gbit.

  * Incoming network traffic is displayed from a bar coming from upside down 
    (light green). 100% means: The theoretical network bandwidth is used 
    100%.

  * Outgoing network traffic is displayed from a bar coming from downside up 
    (light green). 100% means: The theoretical network bandwidth is used 
    100%.

  * Rxb means: Received bytes in % until total bandwidth

  * Txb means: Transmitted bytes in % until total bandwidth

  * During runtime the v hotkey decrease the link speed by factor 10

  * During runtime the f hotkey increases the link speed by factor 10

  * During runtime the n hotkey switches to the next available network
    interface. If you have hosts with different nics and try to switch to a
    nic wich is available on one host but not on another a *big red* bar will
    be shown on the host which is missing the specific nic.

  * Memory stats toggle button is now 2 instead of m. If you press m a
    deprecation massage is shown and nothing more happens.

  * Some code optimizations on CPU bars. It should consume *at least a little*
    less CPU on the display host than before. BUT NOT *much less*!

  * New manual page (removed some infos from --help and put it into the 
    manpage).

  * Removed the --factor switch, since it was barely used and caused some 
    implementation details on network and memory stats. Maybe I am just too 
    studpid.

  * Improved the info messages displayed on stdout.

  * The remote code (fetching infos from /proc fs) is now written in perl and 
    not bash anymore. Sooner or later this will be used to put more logic into
    it (e.g. setting uptime intervals separately for differend kinds of stats).

  * Re-add the --title startup params which specifies the window title of the
    loadbars session.

  * Some code refactoring.

  * New wishlist brainstorming for next released (see docs/wishlist).

loadbars (0.5.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Introduce new param --hasagent. With --hasagent 1 loadbars will not
    run 'ssh-add' which would ask for your SSH key password to add it to 
    the ssh agent. With --hasagent 0 (default value) loadbars will run
    'ssh-add' on startup in order to add your SSH key to the SSH agent.

  * Add openssh-client dependency to the .deb package.

  * Some code bugfixing.

 -- Paul Buetow <paul@buetow.org>  Tue, 01 May 2012 11:57:27 +0200

  	clusterA server01 server02
  	clusterB clusterA server03 
    So --cluster clusterB will connect to server01 server02 and server03 
  * --hosts option supports username to be specified. E.g.:
  	# ./loadbars --hosts user1@server01,user2@server02
