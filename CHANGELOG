* Auto re-enable text display if text does fit again into window 
* Key right increases window width by 100px and left decreases by 100px
* Key down increases window height by 100px and up decreases by 100px
* Set 'samples' default values from 1000 down to 500.

Tue Dec 27 12:28:40 CET 2011
* Released v0.3.1
* --cluster option (which reads the ClusterSSH config file /etc/clusters/)
  also supports clusters of clusters. e.g.:
	$ cat /etc/clusters
	clusterA server01 server02
	clusterB clusterA server03 
  So --cluster clusterB will connect to server01 server02 and server03 
* --hosts option supports username to be specified. E.g.:
	# ./loadbars --hosts user1@server01,user2@server02
  will connect to server01 using user1 and server02 with user2.

  support. E.g. './loadbars --cluster server' reads cluster server from
  the /etc/clusters file.
