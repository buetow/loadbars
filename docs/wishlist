TODO FOR NEXT RELEASE:
* Graph scale factor should work for all graphs
* Optimize data polling intervals and make it configurable

MORE STUFF:

* Optimize code (too much cpu usage if there are too many hosts involved). E.g. do more stuff on the remote side (preparing the data).
* Fast hostnum display
* --tiny switch
* More stats for memory
* More stats for network
* Auto detect single core boxes
* Allow bash expansion/wildcards (e.g. loadbars --hosts server{01..30}
* Make bars mor modular (e.g. atm there is always a cpu bar, and network and mem are optional, everything should be optional).
