NAME
    loadbars - Small tool to observe server loads

SYNOPSIS
    For any program help check out --help on command line or 'h' during
    program execution.

DESCRIPTION
    Loadbars is a small script that can be used to observe CPU loads of
    several remote servers at once in real time. It connects with SSH (using
    SSH public/private key auth) to several servers at once and vizualizes
    all server CPUs and memory statistics right next each other (either
    summarized or each core separately). Loadbars is not a tool for
    collecting CPU loads and drawing graphs for later analysis. However,
    since such tools require a significant amount of time before producing
    results, Loadbars lets you observe the current state immediately.
    Loadbars does not remember or record any load information. It just shows
    the current CPU usages like top or vmstat does.
